# mockups
You need XCode already installed in your laptop to be able to view the mockups. Open the .xcodeproj file under any one of the four sub-folders to view the mockup for that particular feature.

Features:
1. Carpool (BuzzPool-main): The main feature we decided to go ahead with after extensive user interviews conducted by everyone in the team.
2. Grocery (BuzzPool-grocery)
3. Tutoring (BuzzPool-tutoring) 
4. 3 in 1 (BuzzPool_3_in_1): Under this mockup you'll find all the above three features under one roof.
